ultimate guide to traveling to colombia you will see why i think this a top travel destination i asked myself all those questions a few months back when my boyfriend our dog brodie and i decided to spend2 months in mexico the holidays in thedominican republic and then start our south america trip incolombia i specialize intravel planningand ive now added various cities in colombia to my list of destinations in over 46 countries we werent sure how long we would stay here we figured 2 weeks was a good starting point its now 3 months later and were forcing ourselves to move on to peru so that we can explore more of south america i can honestly say thatthe only risk to visiting colombia is not wanting to leave three months in colombia and my conclusion is yes it is a safe destination with an endless amount of things to do and wonderful welcoming people ive met solo female travelers along the way travelers that do not speak spanish and retired americans living here safety in colombia speaks for itself when you find such a variety of people in this country as with any destination we always research which neighborhoods are best to live in i can tell you that near parque el virrey in bogotá bocagrande in cartagena and laureles in medellín were great choices these are all well developed neighborhoodspet friendly for brodiefull of restaurants and cafes for work and safe to walk in at night these are the places we have visited throughout the country marked in the map below bogotá zipaquirá cartagena barranquilla parque nacional tayrona in santa marta guatapé and medellín i have to add that thecolombian coffee trianglewas a strongly recommended stop pereira armenia and manizales found in the western end of the andes where you can find the world recognized coffee in the essence of time we did not make a stop there and decided to explore the coffee plantations around medellín instead other stops worth mentioning thelajas sanctuarylocated in ipiales close to the border with ecuador visit to salento to hikecocora valleyand find nearly 200ft tall palm trees san andres island a caribbean paradise thats 15h flight from cartagena trek to the archeological site ofthe lost citycuidad perdida in colombias sierra nevada de santa marta while we really wanted to visit those places too we finally booked our next flight to leave colombia and continue our trip to peru as we make our way down to argentina it leaves quite enough of things left to do here for us to return to colombia one day where do i even begin pictures are worth a thousand words so ill share with you some of my favorites this city surprised us with how much we genuinely loved our stay there things to do in bogotá include visiting the largest collection of gold at museo de oro seeing fernando boteros famous oversized artwork and getting lost through bohemian alleys by plazoleta chorro de quevedo we stayed in the neighborhood around parque el virrey very active and dog friendly full of international restaurants and bars around the zona rosa and a good hub to connect to the rest of the citys main stops via uber or transmilenio their public transport system to book this experience with city transfer from bogota to zipaquirá i can recommend this tour cartagena de indias is a special place because it has the best of both worlds historic walled city with cobble streets and the most extensive fortifications in south america and the caribbean coastline with the white sand rosario islands a short boat ride away we stayed in bocagrande also known as little miami full of sky high apartment buildings and rooftop hotel bars for tour with 1h roundtrip transportation and lunch included side notewe could not take any photos but the rosario islands is home to abioluminescent plankton a phenomenon that makes the waters glow in the dark as you swim in them this tour is most recommended when there it not a full moon to see the colors more clearly let me know if you need help arranging this experience definitely a bucket list check for us and very unique only found in few places in the world we had the most incredible experience in this national park close to santa marta and along the caribbean coastline this is a place to hike and disconnect from the world while enjoying incredible views and virgin beaches there are many options as far as traditional campsites glamping on the beach or staying at the ecohabs inside the park i recommend a minimum of 2 days to see the most of parque tayrona thanks to the awesome advice from my colombian friend diana and our argentinian friends joe and belu it really helped talking to someone who had already been there to plan properly definitely no wifi at the park this is a recognized by unesco as a masterpiece of the oral and intangible heritage of humanity we met people from all over the world and celebrated with over 12 hours of parades this is the second largest carnaval after rios not to be missed if you are in colombia in march this is our last stop in colombia before heading to peru medellín is a city found in a valley and its also known as the city of eternal spring its metro cable connects the citys inhabitants and provides a panoramic view of the city were staying in laureles in the heart of the city in a very walking friendly neighborhood full of coffeeshops and expats a full day tour is the best way to see guatapé the reservoir and piedra del peñol we calculated a do it your own option and it was most cost effective and much more convenient to book an organized tour instead breakfast and lunch included colombia todayfirst things first colombias past has tainted others perception of the country however this country has been basically reborn this is not the same place that we saw in the news in the 80s and 90s it has evolved significantly with the help of sustainable modernization and urbanization projects investment in tourism and decline of the war on drugs after the death of narcoterrorist pablo escobar in 1993 diversityit is rich in diversity and ecology you can find the andes mountains cities in valleys cities at 10000 ft above sea level dense rainforests white sand

a relatively small country located in the central part of the continent however it is a fantastic option to check out some unique destinations in south america not to mention that this country could be a good choice if you ever try to move internationally we know that moving to another continent can be very stressful and filled with anxiety but try tokeep a positive mindset there is no need to worry if you have made the right choice since paraguay is well known forits safetyand mild and pleasant climate have that in mind if you ever plan to move there as for its capital asuncion located on the banks of the paraguay river is filled with exciting content here are some examples the seat of the government of paraguay palacio de lopez is a beautiful construction that is even more extravagant at night when all the lights come on and if you are an art lover asuncions art museums are must visit places there are various museo del barro museo de bellas artes museo de arte sacro fundacion texo etc and if you love animals and nature we suggest visiting the botanical garden and zoo of asuncion or the delightful crystal fall located in the jungle area the colorful city of valparaíso is a must see if you are visiting chile it is located about 80 miles northwest of the much more known country capital santiago it is the countrys cultural center famous for its street art brightly colored houses and seaside views resembling someeuropean cities in 2003 the town was placed on unescos world heritage list poet pablo neruda one of its most famous inhabitants often described it as beautiful chaos partly because of its specific geography between a mountain range and the ocean the city is a maze of steep inclines narrow streets and staircases making some city landmarks reachable only by foot or funicular so be prepared for a lot of walking that will finally pay off because this is one of those places where if you like photography you will not put your camera down for a second plus you can treat yourself towine tours of chileas a reward for all your hard work when it comes to sightseeing peru has a rich pre hispanic culture wild nature and world famous gastronomy that is why it is one of the favorite destinations in south america for tourists but there is much more than machu picchu and cuzco although it gets only ten percent of overall international tourist visits in peru the city of trujillo is an excellent example of an unjustly underrated destination in south america at least for those interested in pre columbian culture and heritage and not fond of high altitudes and the problems it brings near the city lies chan chan the largest mud city in the ancient world and the capital of chimu culture the site is a world heritage site some 25 miles south of trujillo is another important archeological site las huacas del sol y de la luna which is very interesting to visit huanchaco spa is another place you should not miss another location in peru that deserves your attention is iquitos it is the capital of the mayan province people also know it as the capital of the peruvian amazon iquitos is the largest city in the world that isnt connected to any other by road the only way to access it is either by boat or plane and that is part of its charm lush nature and the multitude of animals that live in a nearby jungle draw in the tourists who visit iquitos choose one of the boat tours that can take you to one of the protected natural areas in the amazon visit the local community of indigenous people or take a night time hike in the jungle these will befun adventuresthat youll remember fondly be sure to try local or international dishes in the iron house constructed by gustav eiffel there is a reason why popular places are popular but it doesnt mean that those less known are not beautiful if you love traveling we urge you to consider visiting these underrated destinations in south america see some other cultures try new food and enjoy your visit

      "full_content": "like it share it last updated on october 31 2025 byariana svenson planning a family vacation south america may not be the continent on your mind however there are plenty of reasons why planning afamily vacation in south americais a great idea we have been taking family holidays in south america for many years now the continent is breathtakingly beautiful and extremely varied there are plenty of destinations that are ideal for visiting with kids every country has its own amazing places to explore from rainforests and mountain ranges to incredible wildlife coffee plantations ancient cities and golden beaches a family vacation in south america will expose every member of the family to intriguing new things be they flora landscapes food history fauna or culture holidays here are south american adventure tours where fun filled days are packed with new and educational experiences for everyone read on to discover more about this fascinating vacation destination this post may contain affiliate links from which we would earn a small commission at no extra cost to you more info in my disclaimer weve been traveling in latin america for over 20 years and have traveled extensively in south america with kids in making our recommendations for world travel with kids we are considering that you will be traveling with school age children eg probably 6 years upward through to the early teens not that we have experienced the teenage years but we assume that in the teenage years young people can do much of what their parents do and so it is not as necessary to only look at family friendly options our last trip was with a teenager aged 13 as well as my other children aged 10 and 4 so i have now got some experience on what it is like to travel with older kids and those who might be physically capable of things but dont want to eyeroll anyone when you are travelling with teens i think that my standard advice becomes more relevant involve your children in the planning of the trip and make them active participants in the decision making show them photos or youtube videos or if they are old enough get them to search best things to do in buenos aires for teens or whatever city you are going to get their thoughts and do your best to incorporate them we did this as much as was feasible and as a result my kids were happy with our activities most of the time while its nice to have activities that are good for the whole family its sometimes not possible and negotiation works a treat if you are traveling with younger kids eg younger than 6 we consider peru and costa rica in central america to be the most suitable for those with younger children make sure you read ourperu with kids guidefor all the info you need for countries that we have not yet visited with children i reached out to a couple of other travel bloggers for their thoughts and advice to travel to south america as a family is to embark on an adventure like no other there are so many countries to choose from before you even begin would you pick peru where you canvisit machu picchu with kidsand see the sacred valley and cusco or perhaps you would prefer the lake district of chile or the lively historic colombia whether you want to explore the amazon marvel at the majestic iguazu falls experience the surreal landscape of the atacama desert take a trip into patagonia or party in a brazilian city south america will provide plenty of fun intrigue and adventure for every member of your family looking for a exotic costa rica trip then consider ourfamily vacation guide to central america what makes for the best family vacation south america has to offer really does depend on the family itself meaning the individuals who make up that family for one person sampling freshly prepared peruvian street food might be a particular highlight for others their best memory may consist of a day spent on a picture perfect beach will it be jungle trekking in the amazon for you that moment you spotted an exotic bird in the trees above or a visit to a colombian coffee growing zone the issue of safety varies by country and region in some areas acclimatization will be your biggest concern while in others you should consider and minimize the risk of contracting tropical diseases before you travel thosetrekking the inca trail with kidsor visiting cusco can take steps to assist with acclimatization if the peruvian jungle features on your itinerary then its wise to take precautions against contracting malaria or yellow fever weve looked

your 6 genius tips for travelling to peru explore all trips the amazon rainforest spreads through bolivia brazil colombia ecuador and peru typically you will need from 3 days to a week to make the most of the amazon surely the mightiest of jungles and home to the breathtakingly awe inspiring amazon river most amazon trips can be added to other holidays mentioned here especially machu picchu and typically last from 3 to 7 days the more time you can spend the more you will get out of the trip for all amazon jungle holidays with children you should consider the malaria considerations take a look at ourtraveling and the risk of malaria in kids we can personally recommend the tambopata region in peru which is easily accessible from cusco the journey to iquitos is also a fascinating one and will require a fair amount of river travel along the way should that be appealing to you better for older kids we highly recommend you base yourself atrefugio amazonasit is ideal for families with a dedicated childrens area and hands on activities through the wired amazon citizen science program what we like about the tambopata region of the amazon is that it can easily be combined with a trip to cusco with nearly all flights making a stopover in cusco before flying onto puerto maldonado there are also a number of lodges that have programs specially designed for childrenposada amazonasis also a great option for a stay with kids alternatively reach out to me onsocialsor email as posada amazonas has three different lodges i can recommend which suits your kids best depending on their age we recently returned from a visit to one of the posada amazonas lodges so i can give great recs whether youd like to visit the biodiverse tambopata reserve near puerto maldonado the remote manu national park or the riverfront lodges near iquitos we can help you plan the ideal itinerary for your time budget and interestsdiscover more here iquitos is most certainly a romantic sounding place landlocked in the heart of the amazon many jungle tours especially those in the more pristine jungle require a decent amount of river travel to arrive at the lodge we also recommend spending at least one night in iquitos if you can its got a unique frontier feel and the river port is not only vibrant but eye opening for families we have been recommended thetahuayo lodgeand their tahuayo river amazon research center to give the kids a bit of a buzz they also have the longest zip line in the amazon south america family holidays are best begun in buenos aires theres a lot to keep everyone busy for a few days including plenty of educational and interactive experiences at the citys childrens museums and parks argentina is a huge country with so much to see and do for a first time family visit wed focus on buenos aires which has enough to captivate for more than a few days a visit to colorful caminito in la boca with its brightly colored buildings and enjoying the tango is a must you can even take tango classes also for any aspiring maradonas a visit to the boca juniors stadium is essential alternatively you could head to the river plate stadium for those more inspired by eva peron and famous historical figures a visit to the casa rosada and recoleta cemetery is a must high on our bucket list is also taking a gaucho argentinian cowboy tour to learn more about this unique argentinian subculture we are already in the process of planning our 2026 trip to south america and argentina is very high on our bucket list with my daughter who will be 16 putting the gaucho cowboy high on her wish list here is a greatlist of parks in buenos aires for those with smaller children if you had more time for south america family holidays in argentina wed also explore salta and mendoza we are totally inspired to visit argentine patagonia after hearing from fellow travel blogger melissa ofthe family voyage patagonia is one of those bucket list destinations however most families assume its not an accessible vacation for them to take with young children the great news is that argentine patagonia is very manageable if expensive with kids we visited when our kids were 35 and 6 i would not recommend taking kids younger than that patagonia is enormous so theres a lot of travel involved plus long days of hiking trails and other excursions see a sampleitinerary for patagonia with kids bus travel in the region is very affordable and high quality but some rides can last up to 24 hours for those long distances we opted for flights despite the relatively high cost we saved by only renting a car for one of our three stops in patagonia our favorite experience in patagonia and maybe the world was trekking in el chalten its a unique little village nestled in the mountains of southern argentina and its truly a hikers paradise theres no cell service and many businesses only take cash its a great place to disconnect from the outside world the bus route to el chalten from the larger city of el calafate drops you right in the village where you can walk to all of the accommodations restaurants gear shops and trailheads most of the trails are pretty rugged but there are many options that offer a good stopping point part of the way up and are reasonable for our active 6 year old to tackle while his younger sister rides in a backpack carrier some kids may not be willing or able to handle that intensity of hiking until closer to 8 be sure to know your kids limits before embarking on the trip for kids who arent up for miles and miles of daily hiking theyll definitely enjoy an up close visit to the penguins ofpeninsula valdes this area is near puerto madryn on the atlantic coast in northern patagonia it has a completely different feel than the rest of the region if you are adventurous we truly believe it makes for one of the best family vacations south america has to offer of all the latin american countries we have visited chile would have to be one of the most kid friendly destinations to explore chileans love children and little ones are treasured you will find the staff at hotels restaurants and attractions keen to help with anything you need chile is a safe country in latin america and has diverse regions with attractions suitable for kids of different ages if you are visiting with kids for the first time you could find plenty ofthings to do in santiagoto fill up a week or more santiago has lots of attractions designed for kids such as fantasilandia amusement park for adrenaline rides and a kids zone for younger children and mirador interactive museum which has science displays and exhibits to keep young minds occupied if your kids are artistic be sure to visit artequin so they can participate in creative hands on arts and crafts activities another activity the kids will love is riding the funicular in santiago metropolitan park there is also an adventure park with a climbing wall suspension bridges and a zip line then theres the santiago planetarium which also has an excellent astronomical park if your kids are older perhaps they will enjoy going horse riding in the andes santiago is also a fantastic place to go with kids in winter there are many ski resorts you can visit as a day trip the largest ski resort in south america valle nevado and the continents oldest portillo are good spots for a family skiing or snowboarding vacation keep an eye out for free or significantly reduced admission rates to events and performances the downside of traveling with kids in chile is that public toilets are not always clean it pays to carry toilet paper soap and hand sanitizer with a little preparation chile can be one of the best family vacations in south america christinatravel2nextcom ecuador and the galapagos are some of the best places to visit in south america with kids this can be one of those bucket list once in a lifetime holidays so wed recommend this for when the children reach double figures or beyond ecuador offers one of the crown jewels of incredible wildlife experiences in our experience a trip to the galapagos is truly a trip of a lifetime and will make a wonderful family vacation in south america weve researched such a trip thoroughly and decided to wait until our kids are about 10 12 years old our reasons are eminently practical we want them to be safe and responsible on board a boat and have great swimming skills finally we want the kids to fully appreciate what they are seeing galapagos cruises at least those that are responsible ethical and environmentally conscientious dont come cheaply however more recently weve read that if you dont want to take kids on a cruise you can base yourself on one of the islands such as santa cruz island and make day trips this sounds like a much better option and is explained comprehensively ingalapagos islands with kids in addition quito is a charming capital city it is also a great base for exploring nearby indigenous markets hiking or even volcano climbing we cant wait to explore the lush green mountains of ecuador with the children especially the gorgeous town ofbanos famous for its hot baths another beautiful and educational destination in ecuador is the city ofcuenca in the southern highlands ecuador and the galapagos islands are definitely a great destination for a family adventure holiday however we would opt for our kids being slightly older when people think of brazil they imagine a party destination with lots of carnival and samba however brazil is a fascinating and family friendly vacation destination for one the wildlife is diverse children can have the time of their lives spotting wild animals in their natural habitat at praia do forno one of the prettiestbrazilian beaches you can go on a fun boat trip to spot whales and sea turtles in the region the bird species that dive for food are also incredible for two the flora is impressively majestic and unique most major cities have botanical gardens with towering trees and interesting colorful plant species your kids have probably never seen before the rio de janeiro and the curitiba botanical gardens are two lovely green areas where children can learn and see so much while the curitiba garden is more about plants the rio de janeiro garden is a great place to spot marmosets turtles toucans and small parrots my niece and nephew 5 and 3 we ecstatic from seeing those animals last but not least brazil has an incredible collection of kid friendly museums that most tourists are not aware of south american african european and brazilian art and culture are showcased in many institutions around the country from brazils history to soccer and more children can learn a lot on this vacation bruna fromi heart brazil uruguay is the perfect destination to visit in south america with kids not only is uruguay the 2nd safest country in south america to visit according to the world peace index 2025 but its also the perfect place for a family vacation or you can do a day or overnight trip to uruguay from buenos aires and get another stamp in their passports thats what we are intending to do in 2026 a must visit colonia del sacramento this unesco world heritage site with its cobblestone streets quaint old buildings and vintage cars is like stepping back in time make sure you visit the lighthouse which offers panoramic views of the town and the river if your family loves wildlife consider heading to punta del este for a boat trip to see the playful sea lions on isla de lobos the town is also known for its beautiful beaches such as playa mansa and playa brava and the fascinating sculpture of la mano the hand for a real off the beaten path experience venture inland to the gaucho uruguayan cowboy country in towns like tacuarembó and durazno you can visit estancias ranches where your family can learn about the gaucho lifestyle and even try horse riding from historical sites to natural wonders and lively towns to tranquil countryside uruguay is a family friendly destination that caters to all tastes and ages bogota is the ideal place to start a colombian adventure cable cars and colonial architecture are among its charms other musts include the medellin coffee growing zone cartagena and the beaches of santa marta taganga or playa blanca on colombias caribbean sea sure colombia was once the home of narcos the farc and all kinds of kidnappings however it is also the home of some of the warm hearted and lively people in the americas also not to mention beautiful landscapes and rich history colombia is definitely a place to add to your south america for kids bucket list mumma traveler made several trips to colombia during the 2000s where she was privileged to explore various parts of this stunning country that is why she is adding it to this list of family adventure holidays without a doubt colombia is a place that will inspire the adventurous travel familys wanderlust if you are looking at travel warnings issued by your country for colombia it looks a bit alarming with large amounts of area listed as reconsider your need to travel however if you read the detail areas commonly visited by tourists are safe with a exercise caution at all times eg these beautiful places are all in red zones but the cities are considered safe i actually travelled by bus between many of these areas back in 2004 and had no issues but in 2026 when we visit with my kids i will be flying between cities bogota with its truly amazing gold museum cable car and colonial architecture is a good place to start your exploration we were super excited to have visited in 2023 with kids aged 4 9 and 13 as a result of that 2023 trip and how much the kids felt comfortable in bogota we have all put a 2026 colombia trip on our south america bucket list likely alongside argentina and of course peru assuming that you only have 2 or 3 weeks after bogotá wed explore the coffee growing zone around medellín we loved visiting salento and manizales and used medellin as a gateway while in medellin dont miss the botero artworks or thepablo escobar museum in the north of colombiacartagenais a must for a few days for its old world charm without a doubt one of my favorite cities in the world take a look at this great guide ofwhere to stay in cartagena from there you can either head to the beautiful beaches of playa blanca or across to taganga central america has incredible natural beauty including child friendly costa rica a compact country full of gorgeous beaches jungle and wildlife well be spending some time there this year and literally cant wait theres mexico which we once visited with a 4 month old the underwater cenotes are not to be missed we also knownicaraguawell the

statue of christ christ the redeemer in brazil iguazu waterfalls in argentina and so much more but besides all these famous places there are so much less familiar destinations that are as gorgeous but not talked about enough we are here to show you the most underrated destinations in south america that you should check out if you love traveling los roques archipelago is one of south americas more expensive and lavish destinations it is perfect for various activities if you are looking for sandy beaches crystal clear water with lots of coral riffs for diving and snorkeling then this is a place

which are endangered the main occupations for visitors are of course swimming and exploring marine life some people are fond of fishing which is very rewarding here since there are at least 270 species of fish kitesurfing and windsurfing are options as well there are only two ways to travel here by plane which is the way most people do it or by boat we should warn you that hotel accommodation is costly here but dont worry you could also camp here which can be a fun experience and it will ultimately cost cheaper you just need topack everything you may needand enjoy paraguay is a relatively small country located in the central part of the continent however it is a fantastic option to check out some unique destinations in south america not to mention that this country could be a good choice if you ever try to move internationally we know that moving to another continent can be very stressful and filled with anxiety but try tokeep a positive mindset there is no need to worry if you have made the right choice since paraguay is well known forits safetyand mild and pleasant climate have that in mind if you ever plan to move there as for its capital asuncion located on the banks of the paraguay river is filled with exciting content here are some examples the seat of the government of paraguay palacio de lopez is a beautiful construction that is even more extravagant at night when all the lights come on and if you are an art lover asuncions art museums are must visit places there are various museo del barro museo de bellas artes museo de arte sacro fundacion texo etc and if you love animals and nature we suggest visiting the botanical garden and zoo of asuncion or the delightful crystal fall located in the jungle area the colorful city of valparaíso is a must see if you are visiting chile it is located about 80 miles northwest of the much more known country capital santiago it is the countrys cultural center famous for its street art brightly colored houses and seaside views resembling someeuropean cities in 2003 the town was placed on unescos world heritage list poet pablo neruda one of its most famous inhabitants often described it as beautiful chaos partly because of its specific geography between a mountain range and the ocean the city is a maze of steep inclines narrow streets and staircases making some city landmarks reachable only by foot or funicular so be prepared for a lot of walking that will finally pay off because this is one of those places where if you like photography you will not put your camera down for a second plus you can treat yourself towine tours of chileas a reward for all your hard work when it comes to sightseeing peru has a rich pre hispanic culture wild nature and world famous gastronomy that is why it is one of the favorite destinations in south america for tourists but there is much more than machu picchu and cuzco although it gets only ten percent of overall international tourist visits in peru the city of trujillo is an excellent example of an unjustly underrated destination in south america at least for those interested in pre columbian culture and heritage and not fond of high altitudes and the problems it brings near the city lies chan chan the largest mud city in the ancient world and the capital of chimu culture the site is a world heritage site some 25 miles south of trujillo is another important archeological site las huacas del sol y de la luna which is very interesting to visit huanchaco spa is another place you should not miss another location in peru that deserves your attention is iquitos it is the capital of the mayan province people also know it as the capital of the peruvian amazon iquitos is the largest city in the world that isnt connected to any other by road the only way to access it is either by boat or plane and that is part of its charm lush nature and the multitude of animals that live in a nearby jungle draw in the tourists who visit iquitos choose one of the boat tours that can take you to one of the protected natural areas in the amazon visit the local community of indigenous people or take a night time hike in the jungle these will befun adventuresthat youll remember fondly be sure to try local or international dishes in the iron house constructed by gustav eiffel there is a reason why popular places are popular but it doesnt mean

      "full_content": "travel experience discover some of the best tourist attractions in mount gambier you may not know about your stay will not be complete if you fail to check out these cool spots mount gambier is without a doubt one of the coolest cities in australia and of course the second largest in the south if youre planning to take your next camping or hiking journey to the mount then there are some interesting places you definitely want to check out without wasting too much time lets delve straight in and explore these most eye catching and underrated thingsherein mount gambier australia if relaxing close to mother nature sounds appealing to you then the umpherston sinkhole is the right place located in the center of mount gambier this beautiful paradise is home to diverse species of flowers and plants as well as the rare possums while there are many similar sinkholes on mount gambier umpherston stands out as a beautiful delivery of sunken oasis sadly the possums in the sinkholes are not always in sight they mostly come out in the dark when they want to eat so except you are determined enough to visit this part of the mount at dusk you may never get to see the small furry creatures another impressive attraction in mount gambier probably not explored as it should be is the blue lake this beautiful wonder of nature sits just right inside an ancient volcanic crater which gives an idea of its ancient history although the lake is called blue it is not always blue throughout the year so if you plan to visit it go between november to march when the color is cobalt blue and vibrant after summer it usually changes to steel grey theres probably more to the mount gambier blue lake than what meets the eye meanwhile it still remains one of the best tourist locations in mount gambier and the country another wonderful place to check out while backpacking on mount gambier is the victoria fossil cave you will find it at the naracoorte caves national park this mount gambier cave hosts some remains of ancient animals the type that lived during the ice age although you may not be excited by fossils it is still worth checking out as you will learn a lot about the ancient animal species and the extracted skeletons you can observe such things only in a place like mount gambier if its not your first time visiting mount gambier then youve probably come across the big lobster or larry as hes commonly known the red colored giant sculpture is undeniably one of the biggest things not just in mount gambier but also on australian soil at the moment interestingly larry has been around since 1979 which makes him more than 36 years old there are ongoing plans to rejuvenate the sculpture so you can donate and check him in better shape next time much to visitors delight an excellent hotel which is also named the big lobster is located in the same place as larry you can enjoy a good meal and relax while checking out this giant lobster in mount gambier for the most birds eye view of mount gambier its beautiful coast and landscape the centenary tower is the choice spot the tower which got its name from european settlers is currently the most used viewpoint on mount gambier australia it was built in 1901 but not accessible to visitors and the surrounding communities on the mount before 1904 from the top of this tower visitors can see many features of mount gambier including lakes such as the blue lake and the valley lake apart from sinkholes caves are another common sight in mount gambier some of the most popular ones are the engelbrecht caves although most of the caves usually feature many stalactites or stalagmites the engelbrecht caves are mostly dry with a few lakes so if youre up for a cave dive you will probably get a wonderful treat but then cave diving is not for the faint hearted it has never been especially when you consider the mount gambier weather here apart from plunging into the closed in passageways another thing you can do at mount gambier engelbrecht caves is toexplore its historical and geographicalfeatures another eye catching spot you should definitely check out while in mount gambier is lake bonney located in the limestone coast and surrounded by the canunda national park this spectacular lake is one of the biggest sources of freshwater in mount gambier australia its major highlights include magnificent limestone cliffs impressive coastal dunes beautiful land area and many other natural features that you wont find elsewhere in mount gambier it is common to find people surfing or snorkeling in the area dont forget to take your camera because you will see a lot of things to tell about when you speak with your friends about this visit to the mount there you have it seven great attractions if you

      "full_content": "are you are considering a holiday to lanzarote this blog is about our diy holidays to lanzarote and outlines the highlights of lanzarote to help you make the most of your time on this fantastic island lanzarote is one of the spanish canary islands situated off the north coast of africa in the atlantic ocean it is an incredible and unique destination where you can see volcanoes amazing landscapes beautiful beaches distinctive art and architecture and it has year round good weather it has an average 300 days of sunshine a year and only 125 150 mm of rain we decided to visit lanzarote originally because my son had wanted to see a volcano my parents recommended we go there having visited the country a few times themselves some of my content may contain affiliate links for companies i use and love and recommend to awesome readers like yourself if you take action ie subscribe make a purchase after clicking one of these links ill earn a small amount of pocket money at no extra cost to you so i can buy a coffee while creating more helpful content like this we have flown to lanzarote twice with ryanair in the summer holidays and off peak you definitely need to book early if you are flying in the school holidays to get the best prices we flew on midweek days to keep costs down this saved us over £200 per person flights out of peak times are extremely cheap especially with ryanair a third of the summer prices check out skyscanner to find search for the cheapest airfares search for flights on skyscanner we have stayed in two areas of lanzarote costa teguise and playa blanca personally i much preferred playa blanca because the weather was warmer and less windy but we did like costa teguise we thought it was more lively at night than playa blanca especially in the central square the first time we went to lanzarote we booked an apartment in a hotel complex in costa teguise which was under £1000 for the week for 5 of us we then spent a few days in playa blanca in a villa complex the second visit we stayed in 4 hotel elba in playa blanca we thought this hotel resort was excellent all the accommodations are suites which include a terrace and solarium the pools are beautiful and in keeping with the volcanic landscapes of the island there was a kids club and evening entertainment everyday we enjoyed the food and wide choice and themes you can walk to the nearest beach or take the free shuttle bus to playa dorado see the link below to search for availability see availabilty at hotel elba accommodation in lanzarote is plentiful with hotels villas and apartments and there are places and prices to suit most tastes and budgets we hired a car the first time we stayed and i booked an airport transfer the second time we usedwwwrentalcarscomfor car hire and i booked the airport bus transfer onwwwshuttlelanzarotecom hiring a car is great because the island roads are easy and you can explore the highlights of lanzarote if you dont hire a car there are lots of coach trips available and there is a good bus service costa teguise is the windiest area of lanzarote and at times we were quite cold on the day we visited the water park it actually rained it has sandy beaches restaurants bars shops a lively town square and a water park we had a pleasant stay there but we did find it a tad too windy for our liking sunbathing on the beach was a particularly strange experience trying to relax with sand being intermittently blasted into our faces we found the weather in playa blanca to be far more comfortable playa blanca is a vast but laid back resort with a marina shopping centre 3 beaches and plentiful restaurants and bars the food in lanzarote consists mostly of spanish or mediterranean dishes but there is also canarian food such as canarian potatoes with mojo sauce which is red or green the red sauce is spicy and the green one garlicky and it seemed to accompany all our meals everywhere we went we found that there was lots to do in lanzarote beaches water parks boat trips and water sports the highlights of lanzarote for us were unique attractions such as visiting cesar manriques creations and timanfaya national park one of the reasons why lanzarote is so special and unique is because of cesar manrique a famous artist from lanzarote who had a huge influence over lanzarotes tourist development he persuaded locals to preserve the islands traditional architectural design and his amazing works that harness the natural landscape and fuse with his architectural designs can be seen on the island today his works are definitely the top highlights of lanzarote there are lots of manriquess exhibits to see we opted to visit jameos del agua and his house at the cesar manrique foundation jameos del agua is an auditorium converted out of a series of collapsed and partly flooded volcanic caves as you walk out of the caves you come across a vibrant blue swimming pool that only the king of spain is allowed to swim in at the cesar manrique foundation you get to see manriques house which was partly built in volcanic bubbles the rooms are linked by passages cut into basalt rock and the pool has a lava bridge over it the contrast of white walls black volcanic rock red leather sofas and the turquoise blue swimming pool is stunning cesar manrique foundation information opening times another one of the must do highlights of lanzarote is timanfaya national park the park is 5107 square km covers a quarter of the island and has one active volcano there it is where you can see a spectacular volcanic landscape that resembles mars lanzarotes dry climate has preserved the landscape and it has hardly changed in 300 years from when the eruptions happened there are strict regulations of how to visit the park and walking on the volcanic land is not permitted in order to preserve the landscape but also because the soil is still hot for this reason we opted for a coach tour excursion but you can drive to the restaurant there and get on the official bus to travel inside the park once you are at the park a bus takes you across where you can see striking views of the volcanic landscape and craters there are also geothermal demonstrations where they pour water into holes and it shoots out like a geyser and they place clumps of straw into holes in the earth which burst into flames after touching the rocks the restaurant even cooks the food geothermally too there are also geothermal demonstrations where they pour water into holes and it shoots out like a geyser and they place clumps of straw into holes in the earth which burst into flames after touching the rocks the restaurant even cooks the food geothermally too book trip to timanfaya national park our coach tour also included a camel ride and a visit to the vineyard la geria which has very unusual methods of growing grapes due to the scarcity of water on the island as well as volcanoes amazing landscapes and art lanzarote has beautiful beaches with white gold and even black sand papagayo beach is one of the best and very popular with tourists my favourite beach is playa dorado which is the main beach in playa blanca the water is so clear that it looks like a swimming pool and you can swim in its calm waters to a big rock in the centre of the bay there are a few black sand beaches but we did not visit any while we were there another place i have yet to visit is los charcones which is a set of natural water pools close to playa blanca where you can go swimming and snorkelling other attractions include a submarine ride a western style theme park and dolphin boat cruises lanzarote is an incredible island which offers far more than your average beach holiday the contrasting volcanic landscapes and manrique influenced architecture make it aesthetically pleasing and a place that you cannot forget with airfares by ryanair as cheap as £80 return and abundance of reasonably priced accommodation it is definitely a destination worth checking out find us on type your email → love planning your own trips come and chat with other diy travellers in ourfacebook group share

itinerary spends about 9 days in spain and the rest in portugal if you want to cut out a city in spain and spend more time in portugal then cut out madrid madrid is a big european city in my opinion the real beating heart of spain is in andalucía and you will visit 3 cities in andalucía on this itinerary if you are a frequent reader you know my heart is always in small cities and villages than big cities however barcelona is an exception barcelona is a popular city in europe and there is a reason for that it is colorful and vibrant and offers something for everyone i found 3 days to be the perfect amount of time to see the highlights of barcelona read a detailed itinerary on how to spend 3 days in barcelonahere rather tour these places with a group here are some top rated tours in barcelona madrid is the capital of spain and is a thriving big city madrid has a lot to offer from art museums to food markets if you are spending time in madrid you need at least 2 days to enjoy its highlights clickherefor a detailed day by day itinerary for madrid check out these food and attraction tour below this small and compact city packs a punch córdoba was once an important roman city and

this 2 weeks in spain and portugal itinerary even if it was only for 1 night the main attraction in granada is the alhambra and trust me you dont want to miss this getting tickets to the alhambra can

check outthis comprehensive guideon how to visit granada in one day including how to get tickets to alhambra i cover how to tour the alhambra in detail in the post above but here are some options for private tours i highly recommend getting some sort of guide whether its a tour guide an audio guide or even a guide book colorful and lively sevilla is a must visit city in this 2 weeks in spain and portugal itinerary i really felt the andalusian culture at full force in sevilla from the colorful plaza de españa to the flamboyant flamenco dancers on the streets sevilla was a favorite for me read my detailed post on how to spend 2 days in sevillehere with just 6 days in portugal you need to either select the north or the south to visit along with lisbon unfortunately you wont have time for both it can be a tough decision to figure out what you want to cut out ill provide some hopefully helpful insights below if you decide to cut out madrid then you can squeeze in the north and the south as you will have 8 days first of all let me tell you what i mean by north and south north is porto and south is algarve if you are visiting during the summer and love beaches then algarve is probably better than porto if you love port wine then porto is great regardless of time of year you also can spend the days right after seville in lisbon instead of porto and then fly back home from porto the most efficient way to get from seville to lisbon is to fly whether you decide to stick to my itinerary or switch will depend on where you are going after portugal and if lisbon or porto is the better departure airport for you based on this porto is like a mini lisbon but also has its own flair and flavor if you love port wine then you must visit porto and take a day trip to the douro valley with just 2 days in this region you can spend 1 day exploring porto and the 2nd day in the douro valley if you are thinking of winery hopping in the douro valley then you need to either hire a car or take an organized tour like one of the tours below if you are doing this on your own dont forget to make reservations at the wineries beforehand check out these tours of the douro valley from porto from porto you can take a direct train to lisbon see what to do in portohere if you decide to visit the south instead of the north or if have time to visit both then check out my must see sites in algarvehere lisbon is one of my favoirte places in the world ive visisted lison twice now and its deifnitely a city i know i will keep visiting i had very little expectations coming from cities like barcelona and seville in spain to lisbon spain was awesome and i wasnt convienced anything could top it but boy did lisbon blow me away i have said it may times on this blog and i will say it again lisbon truly is one of the most underrated cities in the world check out this day by day guide for lisbonhere ok i know i said this is a 2 week itinerary but i kind of rounded it down dont worry though you can easily fit in sintra as a day trip from lisbon to do this simply reduce your 3 days in lisbon to 2 this is especially doable in the summer when there is more daylight start your days early you also have the night from the sintra day trip to see any sights you missed in lisbon the first 2 days ok now lets talk about sintra i definitely saved the best for last sintra is hands down

glimpse into islamic worship in the 10th century córdoba and is easily its most famous attraction walking around its easy to be transposed to the olden times where worshippers gathered here to pray the mezquita was an early christian church in the 6th century before it was turned into a mosque and back into a church again the 800 plus columns topped with double arches made from alternating red and white stone give an illusion of infinity and vastness perhaps alluding to the qualities of the divine creator this was the first time i had seen islamic art and i was spellbound true to its traditional art form the decorations contain flowers and quotes from the quran the church was built in the 16th century after the christians took over the town instead of demolishing the mosque they built the church into it with a highly decorated ceiling rising 130 feet up the church was completed in the gothic style with a bit of baroque added on later as seen in the choir area see below the courtyard of this monument is called patio de los naranjos and is aptly named considering that the entire garden is full of orange trees this was where the muslim faithful performed ablution when this place was once a mosque looking up through the trees you will see the magnificent bell tower of the complex this bell tower was once the minaret of the mosque where the faithful were called to prayer five times a day while the garden is free to roam about the bell tower can be climbed for a fee this is separate from the entrance ticket to the monument theres a 20 person limit and visitors are taken every half an hour the well preserved exterior walls of the mezquita are as impressive as the inside of this monument and will be the first thing you see as you approach this place cost €10 theres a ticket machine inside so dont stand in line unless you are getting the audioguide hours the church and altar maybe closed for walking around during service best to go first thing in the morning to beat the crowds checkherefor hours below are some options if you want to visit the mezquita on a guided tour this would not be a top attractions in cordoba post if i didnt mention calleja de las flores also known as blossom lane calleja de las flores is a narrow street near the mezquita that has made its way into the cover photo of guide and travel books about córdoba this little street lined with flowers in bright blue pots with the bell tower of the mezquita appearing in the backdrop see the first picture of this post is perhaps one of the most photographed locations in all of córdoba this place is always crowded so go early if you want to take that cover shot yourself this ancent roman bridge was first established in the 1st century ad while the foundation of this bridge is from this time its arches are from the 16th century walk through the arch entrance towards the tower on the other side the calahorra tower houses a museum below it which walks you through life in córdoba however its really the panoramic view from the tower thats worth the trip cost €450 and includes audio guide alcázar de los reyes cristianos or alcázar of the christian kings is an old fortress it served as one of the primary residences of isabella and ferdinand and was donated by them to the inquisition efforts in 1482 while the building is nothing compared to the real alcázar of sevilla the gardens are definitely worth a look and stroll cost €450 every year in may the city hosts a competition to find its most picturesque patio a couple of these winners have got together and opened their patios and gardens out to the public even wheni visited in december these patios were full of life i could only imagine how beautiful it must be in may the córdobese are proud of their patios and will often leave their gates slightly a jar for visitors to come and see their works of art remember to be quiet and respectful though back in the 17th century plaza de la corredera used to be the site of public spectacles like bullfights and inquisition burnings today its home to many cafes and restaurants where the only spectacle is watching people take selfies or pose for the perfect instagram shot but its still a great place to stop for a break or lunch nonetheless this renaissance palace from the 16th century consists of a house and 12 connecting patios each decorated in a different theme i skipped the house tour and bought a ticket for the patios which didnt disappoint cost €8 for the house and €5 for the patios hours checkhere these ruins from a roman temple from the 1st century ad will give you a glimpse into life in roman times you can see the ruins from the road from colorful door and window frames to flowers cascading down wrought iron balconies there is something about córdobas architecture that transports you to its past stroll around and see how many of its architectural features you might catch from the list below the jewish quarter is a part of the historic centre of córdoba jews lived in córdoba between the 10th and 15th centuries and were very much a part of this citys culture at the center of the quarter is the synagogue which was built in 1315 ad and was used until the expulsion of jews from spain in the 15th century this synagogue is one out of the three medieval synagogues that still stand in spain today córdoba by night is as stunning as it is by day its also quieter by night too letting you take it all in the sites in and around the mezquita and roman bridge area are flood lit and glow in the darkness of the night córdoba is about 15 hours from sevilla 2 hours from malaga 25 hours from granada and 4 hours from madrid and is located on the ave bullet train line there are also intercity buses that have great service these buses are like trains big spacious and safe i usually usetrainlineto book trains and buses in europe once you get to the córdoba train and bus station its about a 20 minutes walk from the station to the city center or a €7 taxi ride córdoba can also be done as a day trip from sevilla if you are pressed for time however i really think its worth to stay in córdoba for least one night tip some of these top attractions in cordoba might be closed on mondays check before you go i stayed athotel mezquitawhich was literally cross the street a very narrow street from the mezquita i dont think i have ever stayed in a hotel that was so close to the central attraction of a city the hotel was also walking distance to all the other places mentioned in this post and has a 86 overall score

      "full_content": "2 days is enough time to hit the highlights of the spanish capital madrid personally i love southern spain and cities likecordobagranadaandseville however madrid is worth spending 2 days in madrid is a large city but the best attractions are somewhat concentrated and walkable from museums to squares and from parks to food markets this 2 days in madrid itinerary covers all the best attractions in the city start your day early at plaza de oriente this little square faces east as its name suggests the park is decorated with statues of visigothic kings who ruled from the 5th to the 8th century this square is located between some important landmarks in madrid to the west is the royal palace to the east is the royal theater and to the north is the royal monastery of the incarnation the spanish royal palace is the 3rd greatest palace in europe after versailles andschonbrunn the spanish royal family has occupied this palace for the last three centuries however this spot has been madrids center of power since the 9th century starting with a moorish castle to a christian fortress to a renaissance palace to its current structure from the 18th century a visit to madrid is not complete without a visit to the royal palace the palace boasts of 2800 rooms not all on display tapestries priceless porcelain and valuable décor clickherefor tickets located right next to the royal palace is the cathedral de la almundena the cathedral took 100 years to build and was opened in 1993 although it looks older from the outside the church itself is rather plain compared to some of the other churches in spain but is worth a gander this used to be madrids main square back in the 1600s during the inquisition days many people were tried here the guilty were paraded around the square wearing placards of their sins before being executed today its a lot more peaceful or even luxurious the apartment buildings you see around the square goes anywhere from 400k euros for a tiny studio to 2 million euros for a larger apartment one of my favorite stops on the 2 days in madrid itinerary this covered market hosts 30 high end vendors selling tapas gourmet food deserts and drinks like sangria aperol spritz etc grab a seat at one of the communal tables and enjoy some good food with locals and tourists alike this egyptian temple is dedicated to the goddess isis it was initially erected next to aswan in egypt in the 2nd century bc however it had to be removed due t o the construction of the aswan high damn in 1960 as a sign of gratitude to spain for helping to save the abu simbel temple the egyptian government donated the temple to madrid th temple is best visited during sunset or at night when the floodlights are on the temple is closed on monday so if day 1 of this 2 days in madrid itinerary falls on a monday you may have to shift this to the next day grand via is one of the most famous streets in madrid and is said to be the street that never sleeps the gran vía goes from calle de alcalá close to plaza de cibeles to plaza de españa some people even call it the spanish version of broadway or fifth avenue you will find many shops and restuarants on grand via walk along grand via at night to see all the action especially spaniards taking their paseo evening stroll puerta del sol or the sun gate is the heart of madrid in fact you can even call it the heart of all spain because this is where kilometer 0 or the spot from which all distances in spain are measured is located puerta del sol is busy any time of the day or night its a popular site for political demonstrations and national celebrations there is a lot going on at puerta del sol take a seat and take it all in but watch out for your stuff la mallorquina is a pastry shop and café in a corner of puerta del sol established in 1894 this shop is popular among locals and tourists alike you got to be a little assertive to get what you want but its worth it the pastry are amazing i visited madrid during christmas so the windows of the café were full of delectable looking christmas treats this park also knows as el retiro belonged to the spanish monarchy until the late 19th century it later became a public park and is considered the largest park in madrid walk through the park and enjoy its many ponds shady spots and foliage you can also rent a row boat and row in front of the monument to alfonso xii inside el retiro is a structure called the crystal palace that is made entirely of glass this building used to be a greenhouse but is now used for art exhibits step inside and admire the architecture founded in 1894 this famous café is know of its chocolate and churros dont let the lines deter you it moves fast this café is also open 24 hours wednesday to sunday if you fancy a mid night snack you get an entire cup of hot thick chocolate and churros dont miss this iconic madrid spot on your walk to or from the chocolateria you may see a little outdoor bookshop clinging to the walls of the st gines church this bookshop has been selling books on this spot since 1650 on this second evening of your 2 days in madrid visit one of europes best art museums the prado it has one of the best collections of paintings by the european masters found in 1819 the museum displays a collection of more than 1300 masterpieces expect to spend at least 2 hours here however if you are an art lover you may need more time clickherefor opening times days that the museum is closed and more on free admission no pictures inside but this was truly one of thebest art museums i have visitedalong with the louvre and uffizi just a few blocks away from the prado is reina sofia this museum is a modern art museum and is focused on spanish artists like picasso dali miro and gris its biggest treasure is picassos guernica dont miss seeing this piece if you are a picasso fan or an art fan in general having visited thepicasso museum in barcelonaa few days before seeing guernica made my picasso experience complete clickherefor opening times days that the museum is closed and more on free admission if you are not a huge art lover and dont want to spend too much time or money at these museums then i highly recommend taking advantage of the free hours that are offered both museums are free the last 2 hours of each day however lines can be long so go at least 30 minutes before this free time starts start at the prado and then make your way to reina sofia note that reina sofia is closed on tuesdays still got some time check out these highly rated food and

      "full_content": "travel with wendy its always an adventure 🌎 ✈️ 🚘 🛳 in todays blog i am sharing my weekend itinerary in bad kissingen germany my daughter katy and i had a ball discovering this spa town in northern bavaria germany is filled with spa towns and i have visited many of them cool fact when the romans were coming through germany any town that had hot springs or healing springs they would name bad chances are if you have visitedbaden badenor another bad town their was a spa or thermal bath close by lucky you are you hoping to visit germany soonthere are so many treasures to discover my recommendation is always to build in days or weekends of rest and recuperationbad townsare the way to go bad kissingen is two and a half hours north of stuttgart two hours from frankfurt and three hours frommunich haus bethaniafewo ferienwohnung which means holiday apartment was located within walking distance from the rosengarten or promenade of bad kissingen actually it was less than 10 minutes by foot walking through this baroque town is gorgeous too the early 1800s architecture is still in tact restored or renovated our lovely gothic building was stunning in both color and black and white katy and i enjoyed our little apartment we were on the first floor making it quite easy to come and go we had a full kitchen and eating area the history is fascinating of this gorgeous house owned by the kraft family since 1990 and renovated into several different apartments and sizes accommodating families friends girls trips etc we arrived late on friday night and only a few places were open for grabbing a bite to eat many weekends in september are closed for hospitality businesses becausetheyare on vacation august is the busiest month of the year in germany summer break for students eu wide the bethany house also had a quaint garden for rest and relaxation they also provided a wonderful three ring binder for guests filled with what to do where to eat and recommendations around bad kissingen after a good nights rest we made our way downtown to grab a cup of coffee and breakfast atmein kissinger kaffee after we enjoyed this amazing breakfast we made our way to the rose garden is the center part of town the walking promenade that skirts the franconian saale river running through town is majestic the kurgarten or spa garden and rose gardens are meant to bring health and wellness to those who enjoy it throughout town as we discovered more about bad kissingen i could feel the franconian and bavarian influences all around us walking around the park and grounds is a lesson in history and super relaxing for more information on our walking tour check out the vlog my daughter and i share a love and adoration for the bath towns in germany convincing her discover a new one for a weekend under a three hour drive was not hard to do of course we chosekisssalis therme it is the most famous of the spas in town travel tip when visiting thermal baths in germany remember to bring flip flops and most times your own bathrobe especially during covid times kisssalis therme is a gorgeous facility half day and full day rates are available through their website another travel tip is saunas in europe are almost always exclusivelyohne kleidung 😳orwithout clothing these rules are strictly obeyed saunas are typically not located on the same floors as the mit kleidung with swimsuits are and typically cost an additional fee for more bad bath information around stuttgart check out this blog there are also bad or spa hotels in bad kissingen if you cant get enough of these relaxing services and need an extended stay i can help you find one that fits your financial and comfort needs i have enjoyed both in europe it all depends on your comfort level a weekend in germany would not be complete without a hike somewhere for me i was happy to discover there are ruins right in bad kissingen fortress or castles almost always meant a hill or mountain of some kind yay theruins botenlaubenis located just on the outskirts of town and i already researched that a full 51km hike was available through town being our first time visiting and the sun being a big uncooperative we drove and found a place to park not far from the hiking trail this was an incredible hike with amazing views of bad kissingen the romans began ruling here in the 1100s and each year there is a castle river festival i cant even imagine the history that took place right here where we were standing after our glorious hike we made our way back to town for some rest before heading out for dinner on our first night in town we discovered alight water showin the rosegarden so we made reservations to sit on the promenade enjoy some italian food and watch the show i will post the full video in the vlog it was really super actually only five minutes long but was a big advertisement for the town the spas casino gardens and hiking culture unexpected and enjoyable i always make reservations when traveling in europe its imperative weekend travel especially it is important not to forget this tip davitosristorante and gelateria was very full and the food was fantastic we enjoyed pesto pasta bruschetta margherita pizza some wine and katy loves the aperol spritzers it was very fun night great food and wonderful views we sat back and relaxed and rested as the sun went down at 700 pm sharp the light show began and it was so much fun another fantastic weekend getaway in germany we made our way back to stuttgart and as we did we planned yet anotherbad

      "full_content": "travel with wendy its always an adventure 🌎 ✈️ 🚘 🛳 cologne for the weekend is a great idea stuttgart germany is just a few hours away from many major cities around europe including cologne i have visited this city several times over the past few years so felt really comfortable about booking our short visit to this two thousand year old town cologne germany was one of romes largest colonies outside of rome colonycologneköln was a critically important political and religious town on the rhein rhine river for the early roman empire so much history in one place and fun things to do we decided to take the fast train to cologne and it was a lot of fun in germany while taking the train you need to know before you go it was only €120 round trip from stuttgart to cologne for the weekend i think that is a great deal enjoy the view this particular train ride skirts the rhine river the entire way up to cologne and was incredible journey dotted with castles and little hamlet towns along the river the whole way köln marriott this blog contains affiliate partnerships every little bit and i mean little helps me continue to provide free travel tips and advice thank you for supporting ©travel with wendy jon and i were heading to cologne for a weekend to see comedian jim gaffigan and we are also bigmarriottfans we have a vacation club timeshare we bought 17 years ago and when we travel just the two of us we like to stay here mostly because we know what to expect and we both like having amenities to work out be close to the sites and use our points american express will also let you transfer your points to marriott although we found it isnt that great of exchange so we typically very nice rooms and our location was perfect would absolutely stay again funk hausfunkhaus gastronomie gmbhwallrafplatz 550667 köln wonderful breakfast and close to the old town area omas kuche grandmas kitchen große budengasse 2 b 50667 cologne simple german affordable breakfast in a very busy town homecooked breakfast in the heart of cologne and very close to the city center haxenhaus rheingarten frankenwerft 19 50667 cologne really fun biergarten and brewhouse not too far from the old town district enjoy this old timey bar and restaurant with a full german restaurant building began in 1248 and the spires to this cathedral are still so impressive and massive i cant even imagine what people must have thought in the middle ages before skyscrapers wow definitely the most photographed cathedral in germany it stands majestic over all the city the shrine of the magi 3 kings of christ is here and it is just a magnificent museum and historical building as well as a church a focal point for the city you can see why it would draw so many visitors every year located just beneath the church are public restrooms there is a fee i think 50 at the time of this writingyou may want to take aformal tour of the cathedralwhich i would recommend it was inexpensive to book a local tour i like to usetours by locals they are generally very passionate about their city history and eager to share like me also the entrance to the hauptbahnhof city train station is on the second level so again thelocation is perfect for a visit by train thearcheological museum in cologneis fantastic it is filled with historic and archeological information from before the roman occupation jon and i thought this museum was very interesting inexpensive and taught us a lot about the history of not just cologne but the early beginnings of europe cologne haschristmas markets probably the only city in germany that has multiple christmas markets all at one time andmostwithin walking distance cologne makes for a great weekend trip in december too check it out they even have a gnome market chocolate market old town market family market and more yup definitely a christmas market town one area in cologne i love to walk along is the promenade from the hohenzollern bridge to the rheinhausen area during christmastime this is where you will find two christmas markets the chocolate market and the marina christmas market i also love this area because you can catch a night dinner cruise along the rhine or a boat ride or just walk through the park and enjoy nature cologne takes on a whole different personality at night one of the most packedlove lockbridges in germany you will be amazed at this display if you love night time photography i would encourage you to walk the streets in safety for some really cool shots traveling around europe and especially germany has never been easier and you dont have to travel to far to see some incredible places cologne for instance has so much to see eat and do maybe youll want to see a concert for the weekend or just have a quick getaway i hope you have enjoyed my highlighted tour of cologne and you are inspired to have an adventure yourself this site uses akismet to reduce spamlearn how your comment data is

konstanz ravensburg and bavaria are within easy driving distance too making it a great weekend getaway or a wonderful addition to a traveling german itinerary we had glorious weather for our visit to this german town a great day for hiking and watched boat races enjoyed wonderful cuisine and relaxed at another thermal spa read on for our full itinerary bad waldsee was first named as a town in 926 and eventually became a township in 1298 it survived a plunder by the hungarians and a time in the prussian habsburg house in 1806 it became part of the kingdom of württemberg in 1950 during the war reconstruction the town introduced its first mud bath or moorheilbad believing mud had therapeutic properties being so close to ravensburg and under an hour from the bodensee many europeans find this historical german town a great holiday away from home strolling around the lake is definitely a highlight when visiting bad waldsee the lake way or seeweg skirts the stadtsee city lake and also has a playground for children a labyrinth oversized lounge chairs mini golf ice cream stands and beautiful views from every direction it is a peaceful and relaxing stroll we followed the trail to the other side of the lake along the uferweg and found restaurants with patio seating boat rentals coffee shops and more playgrounds this is definitely a family friendly german town take any gasse or alley from uferweg towards the old town district and you can admire all of the baroque architecture including st peters cathedral the alten und pflegeheim spital zum heiligen geist which is the church of the holy ghost of bad waldsee the rathaus town hall and many many more we began our walking tour around town by following the klosterhof street west on to take us to st peters cathedral this landmark is in the center of town and also has public restrooms they were only open for certain hours due to covid st peters cathedral was first mentioned in 1100 as part of the augustinian order or canons meaning living within the community and ruling and remained in power until 1788 this building was believed to be built in 1479 during the baroque era with the two angled towers that were unique in both frame and design the theme of the altar is the coronation of mary and the two side altars are dedicated to mary and joseph the ornate gilded design and decor are definitely from the early renaissance period another historical landmark is thewurzachter toror tower this impressive tower on the east side of town was built around 1400 the city continued to grow during the 1200s and was primarily an agricultural town this gate tower in particular helped with approaching enemies possible fires and collected tolls city hall or rathaus was originally built as a jail or a place of justice around 1426 by then mayor ulrich kudrer later this was also the site of witch trials and 17 waldsee women were found guilty and sentenced to death by 1610 under austrian rule the right to vote was created here and today you can see justitia representing the balance of justice as well as the coat of arms for austria and waldsee at city hall if you are visiting bad waldsee for a day i advise you to park atparkplatz bleichethis is a large parking lot and is open 24 hours on day two katy and i decided to hit a local hiking trail around the schlossee or castle lake this smaller lake within city limits feeds into the the lake we began the trail at the bad waldsee castle it is not open for visitors however as today it is home to state offices and businesses the building is still beautiful to photograph and walk about the grounds the trails behind the castle lead to the schlosspark these trails were well marked although not as pristine as the stadtsee and gave a different perspective of the town we had our hiking boots on and it was a gorgeous day in nature this lake was much smaller and seemed to have more of an ecosystem and marine life one of the reasons we wanted to visit bad waldsee was thewaldsee therme this was a very nice thermal bath however i would categorize this bath as more of a therapy bath rather than a romantic bath in all fairness it probably has many more amenities and pools to enjoy but because of covid most pools were closed they do boast for having the hottest thermal bath in upper swabia and they have many water therapy sports too for those in rehabilitation one of the coolest highlights is the pool that has underwater music its transfixing katy and i didnt want to leave unfortunately it was also the busiest of the pools the bad waldsee therme also has saunas and massage services as well from coffee shops that line the lake to weinstubes winebeer pubs to some great restaurants we were delighted with bad waldsees gastronomy located along the lake front cafe zeit is a perfect spot to grab a cup of coffee afternoon cocktail or just take a break from touring the market square in bad waldsee was hopping on saturday morning with a full market but i love markets in little german towns so after we toured around town we returned to the market square for a mid afternoon refreshment the amadeus burgers and bar lounge is a deceiving place thanksfully we made reservations because this place gets very very busy with many kinds of burger and fry options you can see why it is a local special place as well katy and i enjoyed our very tasty meal on the second floor which was a renovated old narrow house the decor was modern and chic the downstairs allows smoking so be sure to ask for non smoking when you make the reservations they also provide outside seating weather permitting on our last night in bad waldsee i wasted to try this italian restaurant we passed it the night before on our way back home and it smelled so good i was hoping we could get a reservation they were booked but she made a table for us right up front next to the wine shelf it was so delicious and fresh the service is excellent and fast our weekend in bad waldsee was another success this little german town is enchanting and a perfect weekend getaway stop or a stop along the way maybe you are heading to switzerland austria or bavaria bad waldsee is a great idea military discount for rosetta stone i hope you enjoyed this itinerary and that you are able to use some of these items in your travel planning around germany too pin me for later ive been to germany a few times but never to bad waldsee i didnt know there are so many amazing places to see and visit around it thanks for sharing and have a good day 🙂 aiva thanks avis and thanks for

      "full_content": "travel with wendy its always an adventure 🌎 ✈️ 🚘 🛳 i love to hike so much so ive written ane book about my favorites around stuttgarti like challenging myself too every year while we are stationed here in europe i want to climb a different mountain last year wehiked the zugspitzethe tallest alp in germany we had such a fantastic time with our guide bert i didnt hesitate when planning this years trip to contact michel at thegarmisch alpinschule hiking the alps is no joke with a year under my belt i felt like i had a good idea of what to expect this yearhowever when i planned on hiking for several days in a row i thought i just had to be physically strong our little group of eight not only learned what our physical capabilities were but also how mentally strong we were heres our 5 day journey through the german and austrian alps since we had an early wake up on thursday we decided to spend the night in oberammergau bavaria oberammergau this adorable little town is one of my absolute favorites in southern germany about 10 minutes from historical ettal and 20 minutes from garmisch this tranquil quieter town is most notable forthe passion play every ten years the town puts on an enormous passion play in thankfulness for god sparing the town during the plague a promise made hundreds of years ago still going on today the next play is in 2020 on this visit to oberammergau we stayed at thehotel alte postits location perfect right in downtown and the setting is idyllic this family run hotel is average priced and nice rooms with a fantastic breakfast on our first day of hiking we met bert at the olympic ski station in garmisch we bought a 3 day parking pass remember to take changecoins €5 for 3 days next we headed out topartnach gorge hiking to the partnach gorge could be a day trip if you are staying in garmisch too just to get you started this incredible breathtaking cavern would be our first pit stop on our day long trek to the oldest forest hut meilerhütte on the germanaustrian border this first day we would hike over 7000 ft luckily it was not all vertical but instead was varied terrain some being in the woods some on rocky roads and occasionally we came across cold water lakes that were stunningly gorgeous meilerhütte was built in 1898 and the views were incredible you could only reach the hut by foot supplies arrive by light rail but bert tells me and only comes up occasionally the accommodations are primitive we slept 8 in our room bring earphones or plugs if you sleep lightly the pottys were ummmm well from 1898 ha however the incredible opportunity to stay the night in this very old hut with equally stunning views was unforgettable after waking up pretty early on our second day we headed down the hill literally bert is amazing and so incredibly patient even though i dont have a fear of heights or vertigo the steepness of the slope on these mountains was a little daunting today we would hike about 10 hours we took our time unfortunately i had broken my toe a week before the hike but i had been training so long i felt like i could muster through it going down is definitelyharder we decided to change the route a bit and walk a little further and find a flatter terrain even though it took longer our views were amazing we walked through the towns ofleutaschandgasse these little alpine towns are also spa towns and are great for cross country skiing in the winter i hope to investigate these a bit more in the future a few of the hikers caught a ride up the mountain while the rest of the crew tackled the challenging last 500 meters to thewettersteinhüttewith hiking sticks in tow we conquered a very steep mountain at just over 3000 feet we arrived in time for warm homemade käsespatzle and salad served family style and also met new friends and hut owners beate and hans schütz after an exhausting day similar to any hard working day on the farm we hit the hay our room slept 12 however we were the only group in the room with down comforters and blankets we were all nice and cozy and slept like babies as the rain began outside wetterstein has lots of trails around the hut so making a longer stay here would also be wonderful on our last full day of hiking we left early in the morning from the wettersteinhütte however it began to rain luckily we all had rain gear and backpack covers so no one got too uncomfortable hiking the alps is no joke after climbing 3000 feet and 30 miles in three days a few of the hikers headed back to garmisch with hugs and tears and promises to meet up at the end the rest of the crew continued on with one last mountain to conquer we headed out towards ehrwald we stopped off at the hiking hut for a bit of lunch and the trail we continued on was an actual biking trail because of the rain we decided this would probably be safer bert gave us a heads up that the final trek to the cöburgerhütte was going to be sharp and steep right before you have to tackle the incline youll bump into the seebensee an absolutely astonishing alpine lake loaded with ducks happy to greet you finally we made it to the cöburgerhütte and it was wonderful we all had plenty of time to kick off our boots take a real shower although there was a €1 coin fee for hot water that lasted about 2 min remember to bring coins since we made reservations with half board it included our lodging breakfast and dinner dinner tonight would be steak stew with brown bread and salad with a little red wine and lots of water this hearty dinner meal was very much loved this hut was packed and from what we found out a very popular local weekend hike ugh we gotta go down again its all good on our final decline to ehrwald we all began to reflect on the physical and mental challenges over the last few days as we grew closer to the popular ski resort town we met several hikers walkers outdoor enthusiasts and puppies these travelers were just out for a fun day they had no idea of our incredible journey or the challenges we faced the obstacles we overcame the paths we had to navigate the blisters and more everyone became an encourager supporter or needing it along the way it was such an amazing journey we were so proud of our accomplishments and what we had done i think we all look forward to more adventures ahead if you are looking to challenge yourself not just for a little hike but a true experience i recommend a long weekend in the german andor austrian alps give bert a holler youll need him for sure this site uses akismet to reduce spamlearn how your comment data is
