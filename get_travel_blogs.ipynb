korean population definitely check thanks tip admit really surprised things list would guessed butter knives would luxurious commodity goes show traveling runs roughshod status quo makes us question take granted wonder maybe places could shopping household goods cant imagine indonesians could afford inflated prices encountering makes wonder must shopping checking local markets places like cant believe indonesians paying nearly $20 towel surely cant drip drying shower… right ive really surprised agree theres way average indonesian afford prices live middle class neighborhood theres doubt prices im encountering reflect im finding lot things fairly upscale malls cater expats wealthier indonesians even going average store im finding items still much expensive would expected keep wondering people actually pay prices theyre shopping totally agree affordable options maybe get bearings little ill able find items less money im planning go chinatown weekend supposedly huge market im thinking ill able find stuff 🙂 brought bourbon girl kentucky heart visiting jakarta would never guessed youd trouble finding stuff hope find butter knives towels soon 🙂 kentucky bourbon im

easily bought one singapore half price although see quality quite good principle suppose especially since could gotten cheaper singapore korea big towels also expensive sell use smaller towels ended paying around $15 big towel didnt options like design color nothing suppose case demand supply… ok im one thinks towels crazily expensive jakarta beginning think 🙂 would think things would expensive singapore guess thats case comes towels thats funny large towels also expensive korea similar experience didnt much choice colorpatter either since arent many options well think big towels essentials everyone would need get one expensive luxurious ones also cheap ones towels used korea tend slightly bigger hand towels went get big one instead found expensive big ones like one whole shelf small towels sorts colors designs yet 2 choice big towels available…haha… ha think interesting primarily use small towels korea lack color choices funny went buy extra comforter bed $40 didnt really want spend much money found one sale $20 catch one pattern blue white didnt seem bad got home unfolded realized says baby bought babys comforter hey least cheap right post makes realize packing integral

beaches next expat home im going cambodia summer cant wait ive heard many amazing things didnt even realize beaches dreamy 🙂 kaleena going love least hope love much 😉 didnt realize amazing beaches either 2006 went sihanoukville main beach less impressive koh rong hour ferry ride sihanoukville thats went time around honestly one beautiful beaches ive ever seen…im talking long beach ill writing detail soon cambodia questions please feel free ask 🙂 cambodia always one maybes…im really fan temples travelling theres always lots around sea may change mind looking beach…haha…ok maybe another time instead… seriously temples angkor doubt impress even amazing unlike temples ive ever seen beach koh rong list top three beaches ive ever high praise coming maybe someday youll give cambodia shot good hear ive missed guys 🙂 something tells two would love cambodia temples beaches amazing country something magical people really special place ha jakarta interesting lots ups downs course ultimately really great experience love im close awesome se asia destinations ahh beautiful absolutely loved koh rong mean cambodia great…very underrated say lovely people admit though foods pretty shit haha trip country pretty short 11 days think could stand go back closer look one day lot unfinished business southeast asia first second trip also 11 days saw temples capital sihanoukville much stuff little time years ive wanted go back spend month two exploring country many places still dont know anything koh rong really impressed walked across island long beach completely blown away long beach way favorite beaches ever list wish would time stay side island looked like perfection 🙂 lovely photos definitely didnt spend enough time cambodia koh rong top list visit ever return love koh rong ashley boggles mind id never even heard 2006 place going get really overdeveloped fast sad advice get soon im glad guys able get time away even youre foreignexotic location youre used moving around fairly frequently doesnt take long wanderlust set cambodia… favorite destination sea thats sure really didnt think much phnom penh either much preferred kampot kep laid back less gritty also liked food better fresh green peppercorns amazing although id love could tell khmer food actually is… despite spending month cambodia never figure distinct dishes available ubiquitous fish amok time away beyond necessary arrived back jakarta yesterday immediately fell depression 🙁 wondering possibly get back road asap think traveling long term ruined real normal life people dont seem enamored cambodia especially comes phnom penh theres something clicks guess met guy koh rong raving kampot wanted go since 10 days country couldnt squeeze in…but im really intrigued ha ate bunch veggie amok delicious honest im exactly sure major khmer dishes bring bunch pepper back though 😉 ive spent 2 short days cambodia mostly angkor surrounding area obviously enough time know country worse still korean tour aunts mom didnt even eat khmer food imagine clearly need revisit wowwww koh rong looks amazing developed island beach huts mid range accommodation available hubby looking short beach break want really relax cambodia definitely worth visit visits way short theres lot id like see far koh rong goes ill writing posts soon give lot information hopefully help super developed yet ton budget mid range bungalows clustered near pier major hotel structures saw youll likely staying beach hut checked quite theyre pretty bare bones range really crappy fairly nice overall theyre overpriced get paid $30 mine thought one better deals best views town get name want bungalows caliber run $70 oh since island isnt really developed koh rong electricity 6pm 2am actually didnt bother bungalow stayed cool didnt even use fan night cool season think koh rong would excellent choice relaxing trip…it sure trick us long beach one perfect beaches ive ever seen…just saying love cambodia people food culture everything love post… love people love cambodia koh rong favourite place earth far yay im happy theres another cambodia lover 🙂 definitely rough around edges much love koh rong completely exceeded expectations long beach insane wish would able stay longer looks like taste travel destinations 😉 love photos boats ive heard great things koh rong cambodia general glad guys got break hectic jakarta althugh ive never long term traveler travel style adjusted first trip together across us back 2 weeks choose maximum 3 places relatively close 2 weeks 🙂 thanks katie many photos come 🙂 would love koh rong kind reminded gilis built lot rustic oh gosh think back first backpacking trip though europe literally went six countries three weeks used try fit everything small amounts time ive learned definitely prefer slow travel days beautiful photos koh rong looks amazing love bright coloured boats planning trip cambodia summer might fit trip somewhere obviously love cambodia really hope enjoy time summer becky planning visiting highly recommend siem reap phnom penh koh rong 🙂 em nice cambodia consider expensive cities asia noticed using tuk tuk short distance pay 3 4 $ foods also expensive dont understand country base salary around 100$ clothes foods super expensive survive peopleany places rather phenom penh suggest thanks informationmy next destination october jakarta back cambodia
