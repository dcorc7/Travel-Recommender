# ModernBERT Semantic Search Utilities

This page documents the ModernBERT dense retrieval component of our backend.
It automatically generates embeddings for travel blog content and performs
semantic similarity search to retrieve destinations based on meaning rather
than exact keyword overlap.

Documentation below is auto-generated from docstrings in:
